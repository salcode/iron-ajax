Iron Ajax Class
===============

What it does
------------
Allows you to quickly create a WordPress admin page which processes
a large amount of data via ajax calls to avoid timeouts.


How it works
------------
Once you create an instance of the class, you can use WordPress
hooks and filters to modify it for the desired behavior.

After activating the plugin, view __Tools__ > __Iron Ajax__ to see an example instance of the plugin with the hooks displayed.
